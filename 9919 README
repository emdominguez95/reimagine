Bootstrap Website Take 2
This website exists as a failed homework assignment for MMArt 167. The assignment was to create a page with some buttons, with transitions. I scrapped it because 1) I couldn't get the CSS to work on my laptop and 2) I thought it might be too weird. I'm still gonna try and fix it, though. I think my friends will get a kick out of it.
